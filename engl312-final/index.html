                    Hey! I'm a student at the University of Delaware pursuing a Computer Science degree
                    with a concentration in data science, as well as a Mathematics BA. I'm passionate about
                    creative and efficient problem solving in software development, as well as computer organization and
                    data flow. I'm currently working as a part-time software engineer at JPMorgan Chase maintaining
                    data compilation and analysis software. After graduating with my degrees, I
                    hope to land a job decluttering, fixing, and rebuilding digital data systems. Outside of work,
                    I enjoy tinkering with game development, listening to psychedelic rock music, and playing
                    badminton with friends. I'm based in the northern Delaware area with my two pets, a nice
                    orange cat named Teddy and a mean tabby cat named Buttercup.

                    This assignment tasked me with writing an internal report for a company recommending
                    changes to their social media strategy based on a case study we reviewed in class. I
                    chose the topic of how Starbucks can align their social media presence to cater towards
                    traditional urbanist cafés, something that international locations have encouraged but
                    the domestic market has lapsed in. This report demonstrates my ability to analyze
                    competitors' business practices and how I can use argumentation and persuasion to develop
                    sound strategies of my own.

                    This assignment tasked me with writing a classical argumentative paper based
                    on self-research into a topic of our choosing, then a remediation of that
                    argument into a website approachable to a wider audience. I chose the topic
                    of car dependency in America after spending several summers commuting from
                    Middletown to Wilmington for my job. This research paper demonstrates my
                    ability to synthesize different sources into a logical argument as well
                    as how I can transform existing work for different target audiences and
                    forms of media.
