                    Hey! I'm a student at the University of Delaware pursuing a Computer Science degree
                    with a concentration in data science, as well as a Mathematics BA. I'm passionate about
                    creative and efficient problem solving in software development, as well as computer organization and
                    data flow. I'm currently working as a part-time software engineer at JPMorgan Chase maintaining
                    data compilation and analysis software. After graduating with my degrees, I
                    hope to land a job decluttering, fixing, and rebuilding digital data systems. Outside of work,
                    I enjoy tinkering with game development, listening to psychedelic rock music, and playing
                    badminton with friends. I'm based in the northern Delaware area with my two pets, a nice
                    orange cat named Teddy and a mean tabby cat named Buttercup.
