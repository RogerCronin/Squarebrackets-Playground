                    Hey! I'm a student at the University of Delaware pursuing a Computer Science degree
                    with a concentration in data science, as well as a Mathematics BA. I'm passionate about
                    creative and efficient problem solving in software development, as well as computer organization and
                    data flow. I'm currently working as a part-time software engineer at JPMorgan Chase maintaining
                    data compilation and analysis software. After graduating with my degrees, I
                    hope to land a job decluttering, fixing, and rebuilding digital data systems. Outside of work,
                    I enjoy tinkering with game development, listening to psychedelic rock music, and playing
                    badminton with friends. I'm based in the northern Delaware area with my two pets, a nice
                    orange cat named Teddy and a mean tabby cat named Buttercup.

                    This assignment tasked me with writing an essay analyzing the persuasive choices in pathos,
                    ethos, and logos made in a text of our choosing. I chose the article "My body is a cage of
                    my own making" by Roxane Gay, an excerpt from her book <i>Hunger: a Memoir of (My) Body</i> in
                    which she recounts her life as an obese woman, how her condition came to be and the negative
                    experiences she's had as a result. This essay demonstrates my ability to parse and understand
                    text at a deep level, understanding the choices an author makes while writing.

                    This assignment tasked me with writing an email as the CEO of a fictional company outlining its
                    switch back to in-person work following the COVID-19 pandemic. I chose to describe the initial
                    reasons for transitioning into remote work, then gently explain the guidelines for returning to
                    work as a clear, bulleted list, making decisions regarding who, when, and how the change would
                    be implemented. This email demonstrates my ability to make important decisions while taking broader
                    context into account, as well as proper formatting for quick skimming of key information.

                    This assignment tasked me with writing a memorandum regarding a widely-publicized 2014 DiGiorno's
                    tweet which unknowingly made light of abusive relationships. I chose to explain the context and media
                    backlash, then describe what actions the DiGiorno company would be taking to correct the error in a
                    company-wide memo. This memorandum demonstrates my ability to concisely explain context, convey
                    authoritative information, and recommend changes to internal policy, all to a vast audience

                    This assignment tasked me with writing an internal report for a company recommending
                    changes to their social media strategy based on a case study we reviewed in class. I
                    chose the topic of how Starbucks can align their social media presence to cater towards
                    traditional urbanist caf√©s, something that international locations have encouraged but
                    the domestic market has lapsed in. This report demonstrates my ability to analyze
                    competitors' business practices and how I can use argumentation and persuasion to develop
                    sound strategies of my own.

                    This assignment tasked me with writing a classical argumentative paper based
                    on self-research into a topic of our choosing, then a remediation of that
                    argument into a website approachable to a wider audience. I chose the topic
                    of car dependency in America after spending several summers commuting from
                    Middletown to Wilmington for my job. This research paper demonstrates my
                    ability to synthesize different sources into a logical argument as well
                    as how I can transform existing work for different target audiences and
                    forms of media.

                    This assignment tasked me with writing an argumentative essay about what can
                    be learned from an underground musical artist's workflow, then a remediation
                    of that argument into a different medium of our choosing. The University of
                    Delaware sure does like remediation, huh? I chose my favorite band King Gizzard
                    and the Lizard Wizard for their out-of-the-ordinary creative process and a
                    website as my remediation medium. This remediation demonstrates my ability
