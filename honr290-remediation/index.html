                    King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard is a multi-genre rock band founded in Melbourne, Australia. The group was
                    originally formed around 2010, intended primarily as a fun party band. Once the group's lineup was finalized
                    by 2011, they began releasing albums, beginning with 12 Bar Bruise in 2012. They are known for their prolific
                    catalogue of music, spanning psychedelic, progressive rock, jazz, metal, microtonality, synth, boogie, and
                    even rap. But how does this band stay as niche as they are while continually growing in popularity?

                    Since the band's formation, it has always been the same tight-knit group of ten or so, allowing change outside
                    of the band but never internally. Doing so would break the magic they've carefully cultivated over the past 22
                    years.

                        Stu Mackenzie is the mastermind behind King Gizzard, being the lead guitarist, vocalist, and writer.
                        The band has become much more collaborative, especially during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, but you have
                        Stu to thank for most of the band's existence. Michael "Cavs" Cavanaugh are Eric Moore are both drummers,
                        making King Gizzard unique as a double-drumming band. Lucas Hardwood plays bass and both Cook Craig and Joey
                        Walker play guitars and keyboards. Ambrose Kenny-Smith is the band's multi-instrumentalist, a professional
                        harmonicist, auxilliary percussionist, and more.

                        Outside of the musicians themselves, Jason Galea is often considered a member of King Gizzard. He is a
                        multi-medium artist, designing all the paintings, sculptures, and designs on every King Gizzard album, unique
                        posters for every show, and even videography during the production of their concert-film / live-album
                        <i>Chunky Shrapnel</i>. Others in the Gizzard sphere of influence include audio engineer Casey Hartnett or
                        John Stewart, but very few more.

                    The only change in the band's line up happened in 2020 when Eric left to focus on running the band's record
                    label Flightless Records. By collaborating with the same group of people for over 10 years, King Gizzard has
                    quickly fallen into a distinctive writing and recording process. Trust permeates throughout the lineup, allowing
                    the group to work quickly--they've released 23 studio albums and 14 live albums, not to mention stunts like
                    releasing five albums during 2018 or three this past October alone. Relying on solely themselves allows them to
                    maintain their creative freedom while still appealing to a growing fanbase.
