                    King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard is a multi-genre rock band founded in Melbourne, Australia. The group was
                    originally formed around 2010, intended primarily as a fun party band. Once the group's lineup was finalized
                    by 2011, they began releasing albums, beginning with 12 Bar Bruise in 2012. They are known for their prolific
                    catalogue of music, spanning psychedelic, progressive rock, jazz, metal, microtonality, synth, boogie, and
                    even rap. But how does this band stay as niche as they are while continually growing in popularity?

                        Stu Mackenzie is the mastermind behind King Gizzard, being the lead guitarist, vocalist, and writer.
                        The band has become much more collaborative, especially during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, but you have
                        Stu to thank for most of the band's existence. Michael "Cavs" Cavanaugh are Eric Moore are both drummers,
                        making King Gizzard unique as a double-drumming band. Lucas Hardwood plays bass and both Cook Craig and Joey
                        Walker play guitars and keyboards. Ambrose Kenny-Smith is the band's multi-instrumentalist, a professional
                        harmonicist, auxilliary percussionist, and more.

                        Outside of the musicians themselves, Jason Galea is often considered a member of King Gizzard. He is a
                        multi-medium artist, designing all the paintings, sculptures, and designs on every King Gizzard album, unique
                        posters for every show, and even videography during the production of their concert-film / live-album
                        <i>Chunky Shrapnel</i>. Others in the Gizzard sphere of influence include audio engineer Casey Hartnett or
                        John Stewart, but very few more.

                    The only change in the band's line up happened in 2020 when Eric left to focus on running the band's record
                    label Flightless Records. By collaborating with the same group of people for over 10 years, King Gizzard has
                    quickly fallen into a distinctive writing and recording process. Relying on solely themselves allows them to
                    maintain their creative freedom while still appealing to a growing fanbase.

                    King Gizzard specifically chooses novel ideas when starting work on a new album, essentially enforcing creative
                    work. Nearly all albums save for a select few are the quintessential "concept album". Every one of these choose a

                    Weirdness has come to be expected with King Gizzard, allowing them the freedom to persue projects that other
                    groups simply wouldn't be able to try out from fear of backlash. Their quick-fire release schedule also helps.
                    They've released 23 studio albums, 14 live albums, and 60 music videos, not to mention stunts like releasing
                    five albums during 2018 or three this past October alone. Don't like their latest release? Just wait a few months!

                        There have been plenty of important decisions made regarding King Gizzard since the band's inception, but I would
                        argue none as important as choosing their record label: Flightless Records. Flightless Records was founded by Eric
                        Moore before King Gizzard released their first album, as existing record labels refused to sign them. This is the ultimate
                        form of creative control: they control exactly what they produce, releasing exactly when they want to. While originally
                        founded just for King Gizzard (and related acts like The Murlocs which Ambrose is also a member of), it has since expanded
                        to sign Australian independent artists.

                    <p>
                        A more dependent record label would never tolerate some of the ideas King Gizzard cooks up. Could you imagine any businessman
                        greenlighting an <i>audiobook</i> as a band's second album? Furthermore, it allows for one of the band's bolder decisions:
                        official bootlegging. Under the Bootlegger Program, fans are encouraged to record, mix, and sell their own remixes, live albums,
                        and other works of art as long as some are traded to King Gizzard for sale on the official website. This started with the album
                        <i>Polygondwanaland</i>, released in the public domain so that fans could print and sell their own vinyls. Several of the band's
                        demos from the 2010s and other otherwise unreleased projects have also been published in this manner.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Flightless Records also allows the band to stick to their own views on environmentalism. Every band member is incredibly
                    eco-conscious, which manifests itself in both music and physical products. For example, <i>Fishing for Fishies</i> and
                    <i>Infest the Rats' Nest</i> are both albums themed around environmentalism. One is an upbeat boogie album about
                    overfishing, plastic usage, and the detriments of urbanism. The other is a sci-fi thrash metal album about intensive farming,
                    mass extinction, ozone depletion, and ecological disaster. More importantly, controlling their own music distribution allows King
                    Gizzard to use environmentally friendly packaging. Since vinyls are much better for the environment than plastic CDs, they see
                    much wider releases. The CDs that the band does put out are always packaged with cardboard sleeves to avoid plastic use.

                    Basically, don't let others lead you away from your roots. King Gizzard has made a name for themselves through this. By sticking
                    together and forging trust in a small group, the band has been able to rely on themselves throughout their 22+ year existence.
                    Making creativity part of their band's appeal ensures they'll continue to innovate in future releases. Their complete creative
                    control through Flightless Records makes it all possible. While other bands may have gone "mainstream", King Gizzard continually
                    proves itself as a creative powerhouse, pushing the boundaries of rock time and time again.
